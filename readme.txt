Feature plugin to improve attachment taxonomy support in WordPress.

== Description ==

Attachment Taxonomies is a WordPress Core feature plugin to improve support for attachment taxonomies and possibly ship a default one.

The current level of support for attachment taxonomies is rudimentary. They can easily be registered, but won't show up in a proper UI as part of the media library.

The feature plugin is originally based on the plugin [Attachment Taxonomies](https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-taxonomies/), but will need an overhaul and several improvements to possibly become part of Core.

Development for this feature plugin takes place at GitHub. To report bugs or feature requests, please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/felixarntz/attachment-taxonomies-feature/issues).

The plugin requires the most recent major release of WordPress.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `attachment-taxonomies-feature` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or download it through the WordPress backend.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
