# Attachment Taxonomies (Feature Plugin)

Attachment Taxonomies is a WordPress Core feature plugin to improve support for attachment taxonomies and possibly ship a default one.

The current level of support for attachment taxonomies is rudimentary. They can easily be registered, but won't show up in a proper UI as part of the media library.

The feature plugin is originally based on the plugin [Attachment Taxonomies](https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-taxonomies/), but will need an overhaul and several improvements to possibly become part of Core.

## Installation

1. Upload the entire `attachment-taxonomies-feature` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
